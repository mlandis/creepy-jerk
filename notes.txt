TODO:
- Confirm all proposals are on state=1, all commits are on state=0. 
- Is the prior too elastic? Consider creating individual parameters for l_jn, s_jn, s_bm.
- Remove all CRP, FFT machinery.
- Verify computations by hand.

TODO:
X Need to allow for jumpSize, jumpCount to copy across. I think the increment/decrement is
operating on uninitialized space's junk, causing segfault.
X Moved the probability machinery out of Node and back into Model.
- Blah, get rid of all this activeParm flipping and just define 0 to be inactive and 1 to be active.
